    I enjoy assisting in practicals and while marking tutorials is a tedious job, it has given me an appreciation for the many different approches that can be used to solve problems as well as learn from the mistakes of my juniors.
    Along with an intimate view of academic management I have had the opertunity to learn from many different types of thinkers which has supplemented by problem solving thought process.

    Placed in a mostly research and development centred role I was tasked to explore and create "fintech" tools to integrate with already existing financial data delivery platforms in order to facilitate data mining for various types of analysis and manipulations. This also included data visualisation and big data mining, transfer and warehousing and the main platform used was Python with a focus on tools like Django, Pandas, Windows COM integration and PyQt. Some integration between Python and Matlab was also explored.
    As the data was market-related and purchased, much emphasis was placed on understanding end-user agreements and related legalities, and as such, I had to become well versed in the ethics and laws pertaining to this.
