So far the only system that I've worked on where this would be of great benefit are business/financial applications with a ton of business/product rules and while ideally you'd want those rules to be evaluated in the back-end I think that the front-end (especially if it's a monolithic front end, which is often the case in that environment) can get very dense with dynamic content depending on those rules.</p>\n<p>I'm still searching for the \"simplest form of this\" with the \"most substantial outcome\" as Liebniz describes it, but I think that fluent validation is the strongest contender so far.</p>\n<p>In an attempt to further understand how fluent validation works in javascript, I tried to recreate an extremely basic chain-able system from scratch. What follows is a rough transcript of my journey.</p>\n<h2>Understanding the Basics</h2>\n<p>First, I researched different ways that function chaining was accomplished and ultimately found <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35026609/chain-custom-javascript-functions\">this Stackoverflow post</a> from 2016. In that post I found that there are 2 basic approuches that are pretty much similar in concept but with slightly different executions.</p>\n<h3>Chaining in Javascript</h3>\n<p>Before that however, I needed to define what was the minium requirement for a function to be chained. So this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function chainableX () {\n    console.log(\"Executing X\");\n    return this;\n}\n\nfunction chainableY() {\n    console.log(\"Executing Y\");\n    return this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Would allow us to 'chain' like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">var context = chainableX().chainableY();\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>Executing X\nExecuting Y\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where the resulting <code>context</code> variable would be the global call stack since these functions don't belong to any object.So, with that, returning <code>this</code> I could now chain functions.</p>\n<h3>Accumulating Side-effects within a Scope</h3>\n<p>The next task was to allow for side effects to accumulate in a sequential manner. My initial thoughts were that this was very similar to a 'Builder' design pattern and indeed, when I glanced at the source code of some common validation packages, that seemed to be a solution that was used. However, in my attempt to keep things as simple as I possibly can, along with trying to use vanilla js and functional-ish concepts as much as I can, I opted for a slightly different approach, (but one that was not necessarily better by any metric).</p>\n<p>My first attempt was to create an 'object' based solution that would accumulate the side effects on a variable within that context. So I thought that the initial object would somehow resemble this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">check = {\n    result: null,\n    not: function() {\n        this.result = !this.result;\n        return this;\n    },\n    or: function() {\n        return this;\n    },\n    and: function() {\n        return this;\n    },\n    t: function() {\n        return this;\n    },\n    f: function() {\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(check.not().f().and().t().result);\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>true\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Chaining of Boolean Operators</h3>\n<p>I quickly realised that I'd have a glaring problem. The operators <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> are binary and while this gives the example chain above a 'space' to accumulate results, you can't accumulate a binary operator without 'embedding' values similar to <code>check.not().and(&#x3C;exp>)</code>, which was not what I wanted.</p>\n<p>So in order to solve this problem I decided to borrow from my Compiler Construction course in University by adding very basic 'lookahead' functionality.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, what this lookahead function would do is defer the binary operation until a subsequent unary operation has a result (kind of like the 'Chain of responsibility' design pattern). This is a bit of a dodgy solution which, I think, only works because chaining multiple binary operations have no value in a validation, i.e. <code>and().and().t()</code> makes no logical sense in boolean terms and adds no functional value.</p>\n<p>So, adding this lookahead function as _la and just concentrating on <code>AND</code>, we get the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">check = {\n    _la: null,\n    and: function() {\n        //if a lookahead is already waiting to be executed we can automatically say that the previous operator was binary\n        if (this._la) throw \"Chaining multiple binary operators is not allowed\";\n        //This is just to allow for closure resolution to ensure that the function will retain the correct value of result\n        let res = this.result; \n        //The Looahead function in question. 'exp' is the result of a subsequent unary operation\n        this._la = function(exp) {\n            return res &#x26;&#x26; exp;\n        };\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Adding some 'constants' like true and false, along with a 'default lookahead' function in order to cater for when our lookahead is null we get:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">check = {\n    _la: null,\n    _defaultLa: function(exp) {\n        //Just pass through the value \n        return exp;\n    },\n    and: function() {\n        //if a lookahead is already waiting to be executed we can automatically say that the previous operator was binary\n        if (this._la) throw \"Chaining multiple binary operators is not allowed\";\n        //This is just to allow for closure resolution to ensure that the function will retain the correct value of result\n        let res = this.result; \n        //The Looahead function in question. 'exp' is the result of a subsequent unary operation\n        this._la = function(exp) {\n            return res &#x26;&#x26; exp;\n        };\n        return this;\n    },\n    tautology: function() {\n        var eval = (this._la) ? this._la : this._defaultLa;\n        this.result = eval(true);\n        this._la = null;\n        return this;\n    },\n    fallacy: function () {\n        var eval = (this._la) ? this._la : this._defaultLa;\n        this.result = eval(false);\n        this._la = null;\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(check.tautology().and().tautology().result);\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>true\n</code></pre>\n<p>All that is left to do is to extend this concept to the <code>OR</code> and <code>NOT</code> operators. However the <code>NOT</code> operator, despite being a unary operator, still needs to be implemented as a deferred operation since we're negating the result of the operation after it, i.e. we need it to look like <code>not().operation()</code>.</p>\n<p>The resulting snippet becomes:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">check = {\n    result: null,\n    _la: null,\n    _defaultLa: function(exp) {\n        //Just pass through the value \n        return exp;\n    },\n    not: function() {\n        var eval = (this._la) ? this._la : this._defaultLa;\n        var res = this.result;\n        this._la = function(exp) {\n            //We pass in eval to the function stack by taking advantage of javascript closures\n            return eval(!exp);\n        }\n        return this;\n    },\n    and: function() {\n        //if a lookahead is already waiting to be executed we can automatically say that the previous operator was binary\n        if (this._la) throw \"Chaining multiple binary operators is not allowed\";\n        //This is just to allow for closure resolution to ensure that the function will retain the correct value of result\n        let res = this.result; \n        //The Looahead function in question. 'exp' is the result of a subsequent unary operation\n        this._la = function(exp) {\n            return res &#x26;&#x26; exp;\n        };\n        return this;\n    },\n    or: function() {\n        //if a lookahead is already waiting to be executed we can automatically say that the previous operator was binary\n        if (this._la) throw \"Chaining multiple binary operators is not allowed\";\n        //This is just to allow for closure resolution to ensure that the function will retain the correct value of result\n        let res = this.result; \n        //The Looahead function in question. 'exp' is the result of a subsequent unary operation\n        this._la = function(exp) {\n            return res || exp;\n        };\n        return this;\n    },\n    tautology: function() {\n        var eval = (this._la) ? this._la : this._defaultLa;\n        this.result = eval(true);\n        this._la = null;\n        return this;\n    },\n    fallacy: function () {\n        var eval = (this._la) ? this._la : this._defaultLa;\n        this.result = eval(false);\n        this._la = null;\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(check.fallacy().or().not().fallacy().result);\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>true\n</code></pre>\n<p>And there you have it. This is a working, chainable, admittedly ultra-basic fluent validator that you can extent by adding more operators and dependant objects etc.</p>\n<h3>Final Product</h3>\n<p>However, to make it a bit more usable and extendable I thought converting this to a context-full, generic-ish object would be better:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">function fcheck() {\n        this.result = null;\n        this._la = null;\n        this._defaultLa = function(exp) {\n            return exp;\n        };\n        this._preval = function (exp) {\n            var eval = (this._la) ?
