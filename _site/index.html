      <p>I have a relatively advanced view of the professional environment which is owed to my journey of various <a href="#experience">vocational and freelance jobs over my university years</a>. I have a well-established skill set in Software Development and have assisted in various roles from research and development to web and application development. This has allowed me to become a strong and versatile programmer with a deep understanding of where academic concepts end and real-world application and techniques begin.</p>

<p>My experience with different types of employers and work environments have also made me a good communicator who is able to understand what a user or client wants in order to communicate as effectively as possible in a professional manner befitting the corporate atmosphere while catering for those who do not share my skill set or technical knowledge</p>

<p>I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>C++</mark> and <mark>Web Development Technologies<mark></mark></mark></p>

</p><p>I enjoy assisting in practicals and while marking tutorials is a tedious job, it has given me an appreciation for the many different approches that can be used to solve problems as well as learn from the mistakes of my juniors.
Along with an intimate view of academic management I have had the opportunity to learn from many different types of thinkers which has supplemented by problem solving thought process.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>Placed in a mostly research and development centred role I was tasked to explore and create “fintech” tools to integrate with already existing financial data delivery platforms in order to facilitate data mining for various types of analysis and manipulations. This also included data visualisation and big data mining, transfer and warehousing and the main platform used was Python with a focus on tools like Django, Pandas, Windows COM integration and PyQt. Some integration between Python and Matlab was also explored.
As the data was market-related and purchased, much emphasis was placed on understanding end-user agreements and related legalities, and as such, I had to become well versed in the ethics and laws pertaining to this.</p>
