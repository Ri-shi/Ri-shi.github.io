As part of out final year Capstone Project for our BSc. Computer Science degree me and my team worked on a surveillance system as specified by our clients, AWS Cape Town. We called this piece of serverless cloud software 'Watchdog'.

Watchdog is a security surveillance system that notifies owners of possible intruders in real-time. [This repository](https://github.com/COS301-SE-2020/Watchdog) forms part of the home control panel (HCP) that is a stand-alone python program that runs locally on the user's computer machine. This program aggregates the IP video footage to identify faces using state of the art facial detection and has a number of additional value-adding features

## Project Description:

Home break-ins were rated the number one crime in South Africa in 2018/2019 period. There were about 1,3 million incidents of housebreaking affecting 5,8% of households in South Africa. Approximately 48% of affected households reported incidents to the police.

Watchdog set out to increase the number of reports to the police by providing the home owner with real-time notifications of tangible evidence of when possible intruders have been identified in their IP camera feed.
